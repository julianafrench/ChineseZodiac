		<h3>Personality:</h3>
		<h4>intelligent, wise, materialistic, calm, courageous, lively, and communicative</h4>
		<p>
        Snakes, according to Chinese culture, are the most enigmatic out of
        the 12 signs and anyone born in the year of the snake tends to be more
        intuitive than most people.
		</p>
		<p>
        They are also said to be very intelligent; however, they are very
        quiet. Snakes are seen as great thinkers who persist to succeed and hate
        to fail.
		</p>
		<p>
        Although they are very intelligent, they are also very materialistic
        and love to own the absolute best of everything. Since they prefer to
        work alone, they also get stressed very easily.

		<h3>Suitable Careers:</h3>
		<h4>scientist, analyst, investigator, painter, potter,
		jeweler, astrologer, magician, dietician, and sociologist</h4>
		<p>
        Since snakes are very intelligent, they tend to lean towards a more
        mathematical or scientific career.
		</p>
		<p>
        They are very precise, which makes for a very good jeweler or magician
        because those professions take great care in the details. Their best
        career months will be the third, sixth and eleventh months of the
        Chinese Lunar year.
		</p>

	<div class="container">
		<h3>Relationships:</h3>
		<p>
        Single snakes will have many harmonious romantic encounters. Married
        snakes should not play with love because they are very affected by
        gossip from their neighbours. Therefore, they should deal with their
        spouses and lovers seriously to avoid suffering any consequences.
		</p>
		<p>
        During the second and seventh Chinese lunar months, they should be
        careful and calm when dealing with relationship issues.
